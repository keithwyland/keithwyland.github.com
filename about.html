<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm Keith, I'm a front-end web developer in Appleton, Wisconsin, and this here's my blog. I like to learn, share knowledge about, and do front-end web development.</p>

<p>Besides all that tech stuff, I like hiking, mountain biking, and reading books that challenge me to love and listen better.</p>
