<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm Keith, I'm a front-end web developer in Appleton, Wisconsin, and this here's my blog. I like to learn, share knowledge about, and do front-end web development.</p>

<p>Besides the web tech things, I like hiking, mountain biking, photography, tinkering with musical instruments, and reading/listening to books that challenge me to love and listen better. And sometimes I write poetry and stuff, ok? (beware, the older posts here reveal a younger, more emo me. :D)</p>

<p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/keithwyland">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://codepen.io/keithwyland/">CodePen</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/keithwyland">Github</a>.</p>
