<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm Keith, I'm a front-end web developer in Appleton, Wisconsin, and this here's my blog. I like to learn, share knowledge about, and do front-end web development.</p>

<blockquote>"I wish everyone in the world would blog." -Chris Coyier</blockquote>

<p>Inspired by that statement and <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/chris-coyier/2013-january-2/">the rest of Chris's thought</a>, I've decided I really need to get serious about the sharing of knowledge part by blogging.</p>

<p>So, also inspired by <a href="http://daverupert.com/2012/11/brander-newer/">Dave Rupert</a>, I went with a <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> site, built with <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, and hosted on <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>. No Wordpress plugins. No clunky FTP uploads. Nothing between me and sharing my experiences with anyone who may find them useful.</p>

<p>I'm on: <a href="http://twitter.com/wylander">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://codepen.io/keithwyland">CodePen</a>, <a href="http://github.com/keithwyland">GitHub</a>.

<h2>Super Long Version</h2>

<p>I've been interested in computers for nearly my entire life.</p>

<p>Sometime around 1990, my parents brought home a Tandy 1000 HX computer. I was 5 or 6 years old, and I mostly spent my time trying to install games on it that it couldn't support, or typing DOS commands that I didn't understand. Still, I couldn't get enough of it.</p>

<p>In second grade my first elementary school had a computer lab, and I devoured every ounce of knowledge they gave me about moving the Turtle Pen in Logo on an Apple IIe. In 5th grade at my small private school another student's engineer father offered to teach QBasic programming to anyone interested. I jumped at the opportunity, and an 8th grader and I developed our own versions of Pong. I was so excited that at the end I asked to take it a step further and put a ball-triggered, color-changing disco box in the center of the screen. It worked!</p>

<p>My computer teacher in 12th grade offered me and an 11th grader an extra class on Visual Basic. He let us work at our own pace, and I ate it up. He couldn't write those quizzes fast enough!</p>

<p>At the end of high school my brother showed me how to put pieces of a PC together to configure my own desktop computer, and we made a short-lived business out of building custom computers for our friends and family. That inspired me to take some classes in electrical engineering at the local tech college.</p>

<p>I've always had a desire to crack something open and figure out how it worked, whether with physical technology or with code and interfaces on a screen. It was that desire that drove me towards web development. In 2004 I was constantly googling what HTML I needed to copy and paste for adding a nice-looking link to a MySpace comment (yes, that MySpace). I finally decided I need to manually type the markup to learn it so I didn't need to search for it every other day.</p>

<p>In 2006, for my birthday, my brother gave me a copy of Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004 and Fireworks MX. Every chance I got I would read online tutorials, and when I did something in the WYSIWYG mode I would look at the Code View to see what it generated.</p>

<p>Between 2007 and 2008 I finished an associates degree in web design and development at the tech college. The books and fake projects didn't quite cut it for me, so I spent most of my free time going beyond the curriculum from my core classes to learn current standards and browser compatibility. In 2008 I pursued and was blessed with two internships, both of which resulted in full-time job offers.</p>

<p>Today I have a job doing front-end web development and enjoy learning and helping others learn markup, coding standards, best practices. I like turning static graphics into interactive markup and code. I love taking projects as opportunities to use a new (to me) web technology or dive deeper into an approach or concept. The openness of the web community and the breakneck speed of change and improvement make this industry continually exciting for me.</p>

<p>I also like: spending time with my family, playing music, outdoorsy stuff, and photography.</p>
