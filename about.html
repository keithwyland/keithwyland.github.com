<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm Keith, and this here's my blog. I like to learn, share knowledge about, and do front-end web development.</p>

<blockquote>"I wish everyone in the world would blog." -Chris Coyier</blockquote>

<p>Inspired by that statement and <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/chris-coyier/2013-january-2/">the rest of Chris's thought</a>, I've decided I really need to get serious about the sharing of knowledge part by blogging.</p>

<p>So, also inspired by <a href="http://daverupert.com/2012/11/brander-newer/">Dave Rupert</a>, I went with a <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> site, built with <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, and hosted on <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>. No Wordpress plugins. No clunky FTP uploads. Nothing between me and sharing my experiences with anyone who may find them useful.</p>

<h2>More About Me</h2>

<p>I'm a front-end web developer in Appleton, WI.</p>

<p>I also like: spending time with my family, playing music, outdoorsy stuff, and photography.</p>
