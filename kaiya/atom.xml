<p>Today, Carissa told me that Kaiya stayed sitting up and balancing on her own for nearly half an hour. So I&#8217;m counting that as achieved! She still leans to one side every now and then (usually to her right side), but when she does that, it looks like she&#8217;s doing it intentionally, like she wants to go somewhere. She&#8217;s getting so strong and smart!</p>

<p>This one seemed like it was more of a surprise to her. Rolling over from her back to her tummy was more intentional, I think. When she first rolled onto her back it was more choppy and she had this really startled or confused look on her face. And she doesn&#8217;t do it as often as rolling onto her tummy.</p>

<p>Kaiya was so happy when she first rolled over from her back to her tummy. I was watching her on the floor when she did it. She looked at me and cracked a huge smile. Then I proceeded to roll her back over about 7 more times. I thought I might be pushing it a little, but she loved it!</p>

<p>Before Carissa took on her current role of full-[double-, over-]time mom, she had a part time job as an administrative assistant at a local college. The same college both of us earned our degrees from. We brought Kaiya on her first outing (besides doctor visits) to the department Carissa worked in and showed her off a bit. All the while worrying about sick people sneezing on her, touching her, breathing on her, or being within 100 yards of her. Kaiya ended up not getting sick.</p>

<p>We brought Kaiya home from the hospital. It was most joyful and perplexing at the same time. We&#8217;re parents! &#8230; we&#8217;re parents?</p>
