See me, Free me, Cold me

I never want  
-----------------You never see  
For you to know  
-----------------The need in me  
The words I spoke  
------------------To be so free  
The things I felt  
-------------------To be, just be  

You took from me  
--------------------The life I hold  
So violently  
--------------------So easy sold  
The space inside  
--------------------It stays so cold  
My sole being  
--------------------Sustains its fold
