"Miss You"s

Things would be so different if Id never said  
So stupidly that maybe we should be friends  
And all the tissues  
From all the issues  
means no more miss yous  
And no more kiss yous.  
It all fades and turns to black  
Theres a hole inside for the one I lack  

And that hole will never easily fill  
The only easy thing for it is to kill  
Problems we face  
Are hard to chase  
Each a different case  
Each another race  
n we cant tackle them together  
The tie between us has been severed  

And that tie will never easily mend  
And the friction between us never bends  
The rays of hate  
To save our fate  
Our falling rate  
Keeps its quickening state  
It seems theres nothing I can do  
To kill the pain I put you through
