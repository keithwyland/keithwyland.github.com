Selene

A ray from the moon shines crystal clear  
Through her window  
She lifts her head to see  
She is taken by its spell and is drawn  
Closer to its flow  
As she becomes what she is meant to be  

Everything around her bursts in  
A million pieces  
She doesn't seem to care  
Her heart and mind are filled with  
Infinite peace  
Gentle breeze lifts her hair  

Dark blue outlines her body  
And her eyes  
As she forms faerie wings  
She sees it is in the moon  
Her heart lies  
From her soul a silent song rings  

She slips through the darkness  
And through the stars  
With a strong desire  
To guard Luna's heart from  
Enemies afar  
In her beautiful attire.
