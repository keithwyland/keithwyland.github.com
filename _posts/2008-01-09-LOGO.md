For one reason or another my long term memory is limited. It stays fairly clear all the way back to about 4th grade. Before that, things start to get kind of choppy. In fact, most of my memories that far back require a trigger of some sort, a scent or sound or feeling. But there are some, a select few, that merely take an idle moment to bring back. Even then there may be tiny bits missing that feel like the word on the tip of your tongue taking days for a revelation; only in this case... years. It was one of these select few that held a clue to one of my present-day interests. It was one of these select few that has finally been completed in my mind.

I can still walk the path from my 2nd grade classroom to the 14 x 14 room. Left out of the classroom door; walk past the lockers and past the 3rd grade classrooms; take a right at the T-intersection near the principals office; another right into a short hallway; lastly, a left before the exit to the playground. And there you were.

The 14 x 14 room had the mentioned door to the hallway and another door on the opposite wall that lead to the library. The door to the library had a rectangular window, and the other was 50% glass. The floor was carpeted, and the room was dim-lit, having only 2 to 4 florescent bulbs. In the center was a table for the teacher's items. Lining the walls were long, low tables with short plastic and metal 4-legged chairs. When you sat down in one of these chairs and looked straight ahead a window to the future stare right back at you.

Visits to the computer lab were weekly (if that) and brief at best but one of my favorite times nonetheless. The visit would begin with all of the students scrambling to find a computer adjacent to a friend's. Each week at least one student's computer failed to turn on resulting in disappointment due to the fact that he/she would have to share a computer with another individual usually chosen by the teacher. Disks were already in place to start the one program we used when the computer was turned on. The teacher would then either hand out sheets with instructions or verbally announce them to the class. After completing the instructions we were given free time to use the program as we wished.

The bit that has escaped the grasp of my memory for so long is the name of that one program. For years I have attempted to describe it when a "back-in-the-day-when-computers-were-this-and-that" discussion is aroused but with no personal satisfaction (not to mention the confusion or disinterest of others). It would usually go something like this: "Yeah, I remember back in grade school we used this program that you could draw a line or a square and stuff and it just started out with a point in the middle. And it was just white on black. And... man, what was the name of that program..? There was some animal name in it too..." Enter the blank stares... For years it has been the word on the tip of my tongue... until just recently.

I was Stumbling one day and came across <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~michaels/blog/?p=15">this page</a> which describes how Michael Schidlowsky observed an 8-year-old using a program called LOGO. As I scrolled down the page skimming over the text and pictures I recognized that little triangle in the center. I looked at another image and saw familiar commands. "Wait a minute... THAT'S IT! LOGO!" I instinctively hit Command+T (control+T for you PC users) to open a new browsing tab in Firefox, hit Tab to put my cursor in the Google search box and typed LOGO. Result 2.5 was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29">this Wikipedia page</a> where I found that Logo is a computer programming language used for functional programming. I was programming when I was 6 years old! It gets better...

On that same Wikipedia page I scrolled down to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29#Programming">Programming</a> section of the article where it talks about Logo's best-known feature: the TURTLE! The turtle is the on-screen cursor (the triangle)! Further down I found the turtle described the same way my teacher described it to us: "The analogy of a turtle with a pen attached to its tail is often used". Looking back at Schidlowsky's blog I saw the same description towards the top. Finally! A memory I thought would never be completed! No longer, after reminiscing of these moments, am I left with awful tip-of-the-tongue-word feeling.

For what it's worth, I believe the computers that we used LOGO on were Apple II desktops. I have previously claimed to have been solely a PC user until February of last year (2007) when I purchased my Mac, but this apparent reconnection with my first platform has done a good job of completing other memories in which I've used Apple computers. If nothing else, the second paragraph on <a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/10/forward-40-wher.html">this Wired blog</a> helps prove it for my LOGO experience anyway.

I hope you enjoyed this long winded flight into my past. I have no doubts you see me as more of a geek after reading it. But I'm OK with that. :)
