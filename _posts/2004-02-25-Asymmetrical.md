Asymmetrical

Relative to you  
time spent and not spent  
is, to me, a mystery  
the former, in reality,  
flies by and barely even waves  
but the latter, in my mind,  
catches up to light,  
and when trying my hardest  
to remember how much of it  
has passed,  
the figures only read  
to the nearest whole month.  
Are you sure it's only been  
two weeks?
