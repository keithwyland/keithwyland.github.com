title: Fuck It
---

“Fuck It”
It’s easy for me to say
Seriously
I need not accompany it with sarcasm
Or a grin, or a laugh

Because my life is seldom required by “it”
So throw up my hands
Declare it hopeless

“Fuck”
A reaction
A lament
For time gone by and time yet to be measured
Time stretched over the lines 
Like an old piece of fabric
Tearing
Torn
Like an ill-edited film
Drawn out and losing suspense
Seemingly never-ending
Walk out of the theater
“Fuck it”
