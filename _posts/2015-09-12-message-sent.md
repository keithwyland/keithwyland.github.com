Message Sent

The message you're sending  
A never-ending  
Bending  
Of the truth  
To fake youth  
It shows proof  
Your white gold tooth  
Chattering with your others  
Clambering for words to smother  
No stammering or stutter  
So as not to seem a fool  
So as not to look a tool  
Your hodge-podge list of rules  
For governing the schools  
Of thoughts that don't fit  
What you've taught and what you spit  
Throwing knots into the pit  
To give your dark a better grip  
Making sure it doesn't slip  
To pull it up and out your lips  
To send another message
