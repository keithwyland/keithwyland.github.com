What better way to kick off a new year than with a little project!

Introducing **[Module Gallery](http://modulegallery.keithwyland.com/)**! It's a simple front-end pattern library.

There's a wonderful world of [style guides](http://styleguides.io/) that I've been digging for a little while now. I've recently used [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) on a big project and it worked amazing to kick things off and keep things moving during development. However, as the project is getting ready to launch, I knew Pattern Lab was not going to be the go-forward solution for quickly grabbing snippets of HTML for modules and maintaining that HTML.

So, with [Pattern Primer](https://github.com/adactio/Pattern-Primer) by Jeremy Keith as a good starting point, I put my own together. Nothing earth-shattering here. I needed a way to show modules/patterns and variations of them without making the page crazy long, so I went with a tabbed approach and used .json files to supply the meta data about the HTML snippets. Otherwise it's just one PHP file, a couple JS plugins, a stylesheet, and HTML snippets.

Get the details on the [github page](https://github.com/keithwyland/module-gallery).

Enjoy! And happy new year!
